    <p>Here you’ll find links to a huge number of free origami diagrams from all over the Internet. Diagrams marked with a .</p>
    <p>heart are some of my favourites. The difficulty ranges from Beginner > Easy > Intermediate > Advanced > Super Complex. The difficulty is purely based on how difficult I think the model is to fold.</p>
    <p>Please note that none of these diagrams are hosted on this site. The link here will take you to the instructions on someone else’s site. Wherever possible I tried to link to an actual HTML page on the site but in some cases this was not possible.</p>
    <p>Click on a category title below to expand that category and see a list of all the instructions. The diagrams are sorted alphabetically based on name</p>
